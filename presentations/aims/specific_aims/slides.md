subtitle: The binding of charged ligands
topic: Corrections to free energy calculations

A number of different corrections have been suggested.

#### Mathemathical corrections

  * <b>Rocklin et al.</b>
  J. Chem. Phys. 139, 184103 (2013);
  http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4826261

  * <b>Reif and Oostenbrink</b>
  Journal of Computational Chemistry 2014, 35, 227â€“243
  http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jcc.23490

#### Creating/destroying salt pairs
  * Are corrections necessary?

title: Aim 2
subtitle: Protonation state effects on binding
topic: Why is it important to consider protonation states?

  * Proteins and small molecules can sample mixtures of different protonation states

  * These states all contribute to the binding affinity, possibly contributing several kcal / mol

#### Why is it a problem?

  * We do not know in which proteins this occurs, and in which it does not!

<h4>Small molecules</h4>
<li>Using tools such as schrodingers Epik, Jaguar</li>

<h4>Proteins</h4>
<li>Tools such as PROPKA</li>
<li>MCCE2 (Gunner et al.)</li>

<h4>And then perform free energy calculations</h4>

<li>Constant-pH simulations using the obtained pKa data</li>

subtitle: Weak association and multiple binding
topic: Bayesian modelling of ITC
class: img-top-center

We can describe binding of multiple ligands

##### The heats of binding as a function of concentration

##### The posterior

title: Aim 3
subtitle: Weak association and multiple binding
topic: Semigrand canonical simulations

* We allow the concentration of ligand(s) to fluctuate

* Measures of affinity and cooperativity can be obtained

* Allows for fragment based approaches

title: Aim 3
subtitle: Weak association and multiple binding
topic: Simulation of ITC data

* Using the data obtained from free energy calculations, we can predict and experimental titration curve. 

* We can use this curve to enhance our experimental design

* And ultimately, we can validate the predictions from simulation by performing the ITC experiments
