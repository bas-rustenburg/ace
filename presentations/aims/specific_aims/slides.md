subtitle: The binding of charged ligands
topic: Corrections to free energy calculations

A number of different corrections have been suggested.

#### Mathemathical corrections

  * <b>Rocklin et al.</b>
  J. Chem. Phys. 139, 184103 (2013);
  http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4826261

  * <b>Reif and Oostenbrink</b>
  Journal of Computational Chemistry 2014, 35, 227â€“243
  http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jcc.23490

#### Creating/destroying salt pairs
  * Are corrections necessary?

title: Aim 2
subtitle: Protonation state effects on binding
topic: Why is it important to consider protonation states?

  * Proteins and small molecules can sample mixtures of different protonation states

  * These states all contribute to the binding affinity, possibly contributing several kcal / mol

#### Why is it a problem?

  * We do not know in which proteins this occurs, and in which it does not!

title: Aim 2
subtitle: How can we take the pKa into account?
topic: Computationally survey

#### Small molecules

* Using tools such as schrodingers Epik, Jaguar

#### Proteins
* Tools such as PROPKA
* MCCE2 (Gunner et al.)

#### And then perform free energy calculations

* Constant-pH simulations using the obtained pKa data
