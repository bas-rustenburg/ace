  Abstract                 = {A theoretical development in the evaluation of proton linkage in protein binding reactions by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is presented. For a system in which binding is linked to protonation of an ionizable group on a protein, we show that by performing experiments as a function of pH in buffers with varying ionization enthalpy, one can determine the pK(a)'s of the group responsible for the proton linkage in the free and the liganded states, the protonation enthalpy for this group in these states, as well as the intrinsic energetics for ligand binding (delta H(o), delta S(o), and delta C(p)). Determination of intrinsic energetics in this fashion allows for comparison with energetics calculated empirically from structural information. It is shown that in addition to variation of the ligand binding constant with pH, the observed binding enthalpy and heat capacity change can undergo extreme deviations from their intrinsic values, depending upon pH and buffer conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {Low-dose pulse methotrexate has emerged as one of the most frequently used slow-acting, symptom-modifying antirheumatic drugs in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) because of its favourable risk-benefit profile. Methotrexate is a weak bicarboxylic acid structurally related to folic acid. The most widely used methods for the analysis of methotrexate are immunoassays, particularly fluorescence polarisation immunoassay. After oral administration, the drug is rapidly but incompletely absorbed. Since food does not significantly affect the bioavailability of oral methotrexate in adult patients, the drug may be taken regardless of meals. There is a marked interindividual variability in the extent of absorption of oral methotrexate. Conversely, the intraindividual variability is moderate even over a long time period. Intramuscular and subcutaneous injections of methotrexate result in comparable pharmacokinetics, suggesting that these routes of administration are interchangeable. A mean protein binding to serum albumin of 42 to 57\% is usually reported. Again, the unbound fraction exhibits a large interindividual variability. The steady-state volume of distribution is approximately 1 L/kg. Methotrexate distributes to extravascular compartments, including synovial fluid, and to different tissues, especially kidney, liver and joint tissues. Finally, the drug is transported into cells, mainly by a carrier-mediated active transport process. Methotrexate is partly oxidised by hepatic aldehyde oxidase to 7-hydroxymethotrexate. This main, circulating metabolite is over 90\% bound to serum albumin. Both methotrexate and 7-hydroxy-methotrexate may be converted to polyglutamyl derivatives which are selectively retained in cells. Methotrexate is mainly excreted by the kidney as intact drug regardless of the route of administration. The drug is filtered by the glomeruli, and then undergoes both secretion and reabsorption processes within the tubule. These processes are differentially saturable, resulting in possible nonlinear elimination pharmacokinetics. The usually reported mean values for the elimination half-life and the total body clearance of methotrexate are 5 to 8 hours and 4.8 to 7.8 L/h, respectively. A positive correlation between methotrexate clearance and creatinine clearance has been found by some authors. Finally, the pharmacokinetics of low-dose methotrexate appears to be highly variable and largely unpredictable even in patients with normal renal and hepatic function. Furthermore, studies in patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis provide evidence of age-dependent pharmacokinetics of the drug. These features must be considered when judging the individual clinical response to methotrexate therapy. Various drugs currently used in RA may interact with methotrexate. Aspirin might affect methotrexate disposition to a greater extent than other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs without causing greater toxicity. Corticosteroids do not interfere with the pharmacokinetics of methotrexate, whereas chloroquine may reduce the gastrointestinal absorption of the drug. Folates, especially folic acid, have been shown to reduce the adverse effects of methotrexate without compromising its efficacy in RA. Finally, both trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (cotrimoxazole) and probenecid lead to increased toxicity of methotrexate, and hence should be avoided in patients receiving these drugs. A relationship between oral dosage and efficacy has been found in the range 5 to 20mg methotrexate weekly. The plateau of efficacy is attained at approximately 10 mg/m2/week in most patients. No clear relationship between pharmacokinetic parameters and clinical response has been demonstrated. Overall, the dosage must be individualised because of interindividual variability in the dose-response curve. This variability is probably related, at least in part, to the wide interindividual variability in the disposition of the drug.},

  Abstract                 = {The binding of a series of low molecular weight ligands towards trypsin and thrombin has been studied by isothermal titration calorimetry and protein crystallography. In a series of congeneric ligands, surprising changes of protonation states occur and are overlaid on the binding process. They result from induced pK(a) shifts depending on the local environment experienced by the ligand and protein functional groups in the complex (induced dielectric fit). They involve additional heat effects that must be corrected before any conclusion on the binding enthalpy (DeltaH) and entropy (DeltaS) can be drawn. After correction, trends in both contributions can be interpreted in structural terms with respect to the hydrogen bond inventory or residual ligand motions. For all inhibitors studied, a strong negative heat capacity change (DeltaC(p)) is detected, thus binding becomes more exothermic and entropically less favourable with increasing temperature. Due to a mutual compensation, Gibbs free energy remains virtually unchanged. The strong negative DeltaC(p) value cannot solely be explained by the removal of hydrophobic surface portions of the protein or ligand from water exposure. Additional contributions must be considered, presumably arising from modulations of the local water structure, changes in vibrational modes or other ordering parameters. For thrombin, smaller negative DeltaC(p) values are observed for ligand binding in the presence of sodium ions compared to the other alkali ions, probably due to stabilising effects on the protein or changes in the bound water structure.},

  Abstract                 = {The influence of a xenobiotic compound on an organism is usually summarized by the expression biological activity. If a controlled, therapeutically relevant, and regulatory action is observed the compound has potential as a drug, otherwise its toxicity on the biological system is of interest. However, what do we understand by the biological activity? In principle, the overall effect on an organism has to be considered. However, because of the complexity of the interrelated processes involved, as a simplification primarily the "main action" on the organism is taken into consideration. On the molecular level, biological activity corresponds to the binding of a (low-molecular weight) compound to a macromolecular receptor, usually a protein. Enzymatic reactions or signal-transduction cascades are thereby influenced with respect to their function for the organism. We regard this binding as a process under equilibrium conditions; thus, binding can be described as an association or dissociation process. Accordingly, biological activity is expressed as the affinity of both partners for each other, as a thermodynamic equilibrium quantity. How well do we understand these terms and how well are they theoretically predictable today? The holy grail of rational drug design is the prediction of the biological activity of a compound. The processes involving ligand binding are extremely complicated, both ligand and protein are flexible molecules, and the energy inventory between the bound and unbound states must be considered in aqueous solution. How sophisticated and reliable are our experimental approaches to obtaining the necessary insight? The present review summarizes our current understanding of the binding affinity of a small-molecule ligand to a protein. Both theoretical and empirical approaches for predicting binding affinity, starting from the three-dimensional structure of a protein-ligand complex, will be described and compared. Experimental methods, primarily microcalorimetry, will be discussed. As a perspective, our own knowledge-based approach towards affinity prediction and experimental data on factorizing binding contributions to protein-ligand binding will be presented.},

  Abstract                 = {Multisite interactions and the formation of ternary or higher-order protein complexes are ubiquitous features of protein interactions. Cooperativity between different ligands is a hallmark for information transfer, and is frequently critical for the biological function. We describe a new computational platform for the global analysis of isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) data for the study of binary and ternary multisite interactions, implemented as part of the public domain multimethod analysis software SEDPHAT. The global analysis of titrations performed in different orientations was explored, and the potential for unraveling cooperativity parameters in multisite interactions was assessed in theory and experiment. To demonstrate the practical potential and limitations of global analyses of ITC titrations for the study of cooperative multiprotein interactions, we have examined the interactions of three proteins that are critical for signal transduction after T-cell activation, LAT, Grb2, and Sos1. We have shown previously that multivalent interactions between these three molecules promote the assembly of large multiprotein complexes important for T-cell receptor activation. By global analysis of the heats of binding observed in sets of ITC injections in different orientations, which allowed us to follow the formation of binary and ternary complexes, we observed negative and positive cooperativity that may be important to control the pathway of assembly and disassembly of adaptor protein particles.},

  Abstract                 = {Classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on atomistic models are increasingly used to study a wide range of biological systems. A prerequisite for meaningful results from such simulations is an accurate molecular mechanical force field. Most biomolecular simulations are currently based on the widely used AMBER and CHARMM force fields, which were parameterized and optimized to cover a small set of basic compounds corresponding to the natural amino acids and nucleic acid bases. Atomic models of additional compounds are commonly generated by analogy to the parameter set of a given force field. While this procedure yields models that are internally consistent, the accuracy of the resulting models can be limited. In this work, we propose a method, General Automated Atomic Model Parameterization (GAAMP), for generating automatically the parameters of atomic models of small molecules using the results from ab initio quantum mechanical (QM) calculations as target data. Force fields that were previously developed for a wide range of model compounds serve as initial guess, although any of the final parameter can be optimized. The electrostatic parameters (partial charges, polarizabilities and shielding) are optimized on the basis of QM electrostatic potential (ESP) and, if applicable, the interaction energies between the compound and water molecules. The soft dihedrals are automatically identified and parameterized by targeting QM dihedral scans as well as the energies of stable conformers. To validate the approach, the solvation free energy is calculated for more than 200 small molecules and MD simulations of 3 different proteins are carried out.},

  Abstract                 = {To predict the performance of a drug following oral dosing, a thorough understanding of the dissolution, uptake and metabolism of the compound is required. In this review, approaches to in silico modeling of these processes are discussed. Although oral absorption, which is limited by dissolution and passive permeation, is to some extent predictable, bioavailability, which is influenced by first-pass metabolism in the intestines and liver, is much more difficult to predict. Much of the difficulty in predicting oral absorption and bioavailability is in the experimental quantification of solubility in the gastrointestinal tract lumen, membrane permeability, plasma protein binding, metabolism and active transport, rather than the formulating of the mathematical models.},

  Abstract                 = {Fully characterizing the interactions involving biomolecules requires information on the assembly state, affinity, kinetics, and thermodynamics associated with complex formation. The analytical technologies often used to measure biomolecular interactions include analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). In order to evaluate the capabilities of core facilities to implement these technologies, the Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities (ABRF) Molecular Interactions Research Group (MIRG) developed a standardized model system and distributed it to a panel of AUC, ITC, and SPR operators. The model system was composed of a well-characterized enzyme-inhibitor pair, namely bovine carbonic anhydrase II (CA II) and 4-carboxybenzenesulfonamide (CBS). Study participants were asked to measure one or more of the following: (1) the molecular mass, homogeneity, and assembly state of CA II by AUC; (2) the affinity and thermodynamics for complex formation by ITC; and (3) the affinity and kinetics of complex formation by SPR. The results from this study provide a benchmark for comparing the capabilities of individual laboratories and for defining the utility of the different instrumentation.},

  Abstract                 = {Proteins carry out the most difficult tasks in living cells. They do so by interacting specifically with other molecules. This requires that they fold to a unique, globular conformation that is only marginally more stable than the large ensemble of unfolded states. The folded state is stabilized mainly by the burial and tight packing of over 80\% of the peptide groups and non-polar side chains. If life as we know it is to exist in a solvent other than water, the folded state must be stable and soluble in the new solvent. Our analysis suggests that proteins will be unstable in most polar solvents such as ethanol, extremely stable in non-polar solvents such as cyclohexane, and even more stable in a vacuum. Our solubility studies suggest that protein solubility will be markedly lower in polar solvents such as ethanol and that proteins will be essentially insoluble in non-polar solvents such as cyclohexane. For these and other reasons it seems unlikely that the life we know could exist in any solvent system other than water.},

  Abstract                 = {Taxanes are widely used for many solid tumors, including metastatic breast cancer. Enhanced-delivery taxanes (EDTs) were specifically designed to improve the efficacy and tolerability of taxanes through the utilization of biocompatible, tumor-selective, taxane delivery vehicles, removing the need for drug delivery in toxic, conventional solvents. Nab-paclitaxel is a first-generation EDT that consists of paclitaxel encapsulated in albumin-bound nanoparticles that utilize a standard, endogenous serum albumin pathway to deliver paclitaxel to tumor cells. Second-generation EDTs, including Tocosol Paclitaxel (Sonus Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Bothell, Washington) and paclitaxel poliglumex, use biocompatible drug delivery vehicles that not only eliminate the need for toxic conventional solvents but also exploit tumor pathophysiological phenomena such as enhanced permeability and retention. Emerging evidence suggests that the use of EDTs may promote a more favorable and predictable pharmacokinetic profile with increased bioavailability of taxanes at the tumor site, limiting their exposure to normal tissues and improving the therapeutic benefits associated with taxane treatment.},

  Abstract                 = {Digoxin, the cardiac glycoside most frequently used in clinical practice in the United States, can be given orally or intravenously and has an excretory half-life of 36 to 48 hours in patients with serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen values in the normal range. Since the drug is excreted predominantly by the kidney, the half-life is prolonged progressively with diminishing renal function, reaching about 5 days on average in patients who are essentially anephric. Serum protein binding of digoxin is only about 20\%, and differs markedly in this regard from that of digitoxin, which is 97\% bound by serum albumin at usual therapeutic levels. Digitoxin is nearly completely absorbed from the normal gastrointestinal tract and has a half-life averaging 5 to 6 days in patients receiving usual doses irrespective of renal function. The bioavailability of digoxin is appreciably less than that of digitoxin, averaging about two-thirds to three-fourths of the equivalent dose given intravenously in the case of currently available tablet formulations. Recent studies have shown that gut flora of about 10\% of patients reduce digoxin to a less bioactive dihydro derivative. This process is sensitive to antibiotic administration, creating the potential for important interactions among drugs. Serum or plasma concentrations of digitalis glycosides can be measured by radioimmunoassay methods that are now widely available, but knowledge of serum levels does not substitute for a sound working knowledge of the clinical pharmacology of the preparation used and careful patient follow-up.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe here a general Amber force field (GAFF) for organic molecules. GAFF is designed to be compatible with existing Amber force fields for proteins and nucleic acids, and has parameters for most organic and pharmaceutical molecules that are composed of H, C, N, O, S, P, and halogens. It uses a simple functional form and a limited number of atom types, but incorporates both empirical and heuristic models to estimate force constants and partial atomic charges. The performance of GAFF in test cases is encouraging. In test I, 74 crystallographic structures were compared to GAFF minimized structures, with a root-mean-square displacement of 0.26 A, which is comparable to that of the Tripos 5.2 force field (0.25 A) and better than those of MMFF 94 and CHARMm (0.47 and 0.44 A, respectively). In test II, gas phase minimizations were performed on 22 nucleic acid base pairs, and the minimized structures and intermolecular energies were compared to MP2/6-31G* results. The RMS of displacements and relative energies were 0.25 A and 1.2 kcal/mol, respectively. These data are comparable to results from Parm99/RESP (0.16 A and 1.18 kcal/mol, respectively), which were parameterized to these base pairs. Test III looked at the relative energies of 71 conformational pairs that were used in development of the Parm99 force field. The RMS error in relative energies (compared to experiment) is about 0.5 kcal/mol. GAFF can be applied to wide range of molecules in an automatic fashion, making it suitable for rational drug design and database searching.},

  Abstract                 = {Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments can provide significantly more detailed information about molecular interactions when combined in global analysis. For example, global analysis can improve the precision of binding affinity and enthalpy, and of possible linkage parameters, even for simple bimolecular interactions, and greatly facilitate the study of multi-site and multi-component systems with competition or cooperativity. A pre-requisite for global analysis is the departure from the traditional binding model, including an 'n'-value describing unphysical, non-integral numbers of sites. Instead, concentration correction factors can be introduced to account for either errors in the concentration determination or for the presence of inactive fractions of material. SEDPHAT is a computer program that embeds these ideas and provides a graphical user interface for the seamless combination of biophysical experiments to be globally modeled with a large number of different binding models. It offers statistical tools for the rigorous determination of parameter errors, correlations, as well as advanced statistical functions for global ITC (gITC) and global multi-method analysis (GMMA). SEDPHAT will also take full advantage of error bars of individual titration data points determined with the unbiased integration software NITPIC. The present communication reviews principles and strategies of global analysis for ITC and its extension to GMMA in SEDPHAT. We will also introduce a new graphical tool for aiding experimental design by surveying the concentration space and generating simulated data sets, which can be subsequently statistically examined for their information content. This procedure can replace the 'c'-value as an experimental design parameter, which ceases to be helpful for multi-site systems and in the context of gITC.},
